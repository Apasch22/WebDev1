            <h1>Rainy day + Umbrella Music</h1>
            <p>
              Since umbrellas have been associated with the rainy seasons/months
              they are refered to often in popculture. Such as making
              appearances in music, book senes, and converastions.

              Berlin-based Alice Zappe and Julia Lager fitted 12 touch-sensitive
              sensors to the inner canopy of a brolly. The sensors were
              connected to a simple circuit board that spotted when each sensor
              was struck by a raindrop. It plays a different beep for each
              sensor to generate a random 8-bit tune in response to the falling
              rain. The gadget was put together in a day for a 24-hour hardware
              hacking event in Amsterdam so had to be relatively simple, said Ms
              Zappe. She said the idea for the umbrella came out of a visit to a
              design exhibition the day before that left the pair wondering how
              everyday objects could be connected by music.
